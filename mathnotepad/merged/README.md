(WIP) Some functions only works at original webpage `https://mathnotepad.com`

single `MathNotepad.html` is masterpiece of programing, It is basic MATLAB in a single HTML file.

Just download and open it with any browser, Then write your math codes.

It doesn't need internet connection to working, It works offline.
